        This [Fall 2023](https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/website/editions/2023-fall/#dates) [Automated question type coding of forensic](https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/2023-fall-forensic/) addressed the problem of [labor-intensive process of question type coding in forensic interviews](problem-statement). It uses data about [question types in real forensic interviews, providing crucial insights for automated coding](data). Our work focuses on [innovative approach using RoBERTa to automate question type coding, optimizing efficiency and accuracy.](approach). Our initial results indicate [significant advancements, promising efficiency gains in automated question type coding.](results).

       Our data science project aims to revolutionize the labor-intensive process of question type coding in forensic interviews. This manual coding, crucial for evaluating interview quality, is time-consuming and prone to human error. The challenge lies in distinguishing between best practice open-ended questions and undesirable closed-ended ones. Our motivation stems from the potential to streamline and improve forensic interviews. The introduction of automated coding, leveraging RoBERTa, promises efficiency gains and a departure from reliance on mock interviews. This innovative approach aligns with the broader goal of providing swift, reliable measures of testimonial quality, contributing to a nuanced understanding of interview dynamics in the field.
