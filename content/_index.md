        This [Fall 2023](https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/website/editions/2023-fall/#dates) [Automated question type coding of forensic](https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/2023-fall-forensic/) addressed the problem of [labor-intensive process of question type coding in forensic interviews](problem-statement). It uses data about [question types in real forensic interviews, providing crucial insights for automated coding](data). Our work focuses on [innovative approach using RoBERTa to automate question type coding, optimizing efficiency and accuracy](approach). Our initial results indicate [significant advancements, promising efficiency gains in automated question type coding](results).

        Optional: This project builds on the work of a [previous DataFirst project|link to another project from a previous semester].

        Our data science project endeavors to tackle [Automated question type coding of forensic interviews]. Our motivation to address this problem stems from [the potential to streamline and improve forensic interviews. The introduction of automated coding, leveraging RoBERTa, promises efficiency gains and a departure from reliance on mock interviews. This innovative approach aligns with the broader goal of providing swift, reliable measures of testimonial quality, contributing to a nuanced understanding of interview dynamics in the field].
