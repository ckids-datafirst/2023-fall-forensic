## System and Model Performance

- Previous model's performance: High human-machine agreement (Cohen’s Kappa: .89); 88% for non-questions, 94% for option-posing questions, and 95% for wh-questions/invitations
- New model’s performance: High human-machine agreement
    - 82% for non-questions
    - 82% for option-posing questions,
    - 98% for wh-questions 
    - 96% for invitations

## Future Work

- Differentiate between subtypes of option-posing questions
    - Yes-no questions (“Did you go home that night?”)
    - Forced choice questions (“Did you go home that night or did you stay with your sister?”)
    - Suggestive questions (“You went home that night, didn’t you?”)
- Categorize children’s responses
    - Unelaborated (Q: “Did you go home that night?” A: “No.”)
    - Elaborated (Q: “Did you go home that night?” A: “No, I stayed with my sister.”)
